  Our Services

  Below is a list of services we proudly offer.
  At Hairpins, we care about the environment and recognize the impact we all have on it. We are continually making
  strides to reduce where we can and have only aligned ourselves with companies and products we believe in. We are proud
  to be a CERTIFIED GREEN CIRCLE SALON and through that partnership are able to divert 95% of our salon waste from
  landfills. Get in touch if you have any questions or want to learn more about the programs and charities we are
  focusing our efforts on.
